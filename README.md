# Pop-Shop Demo (client)

This project is the client side of a demo, full-stack Typescript/NodeJS e-commerce web app.

The client is hosted at:
https://pop-shop.netlify.app

Although arbitrary, the products are an assortment of popular soft drinks from around the world, as well as branded t-shirts.  Placeholder text and images were used where, if this were a live application, professionally written copy and product images would be.
